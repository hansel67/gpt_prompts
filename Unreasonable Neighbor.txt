Act like an unreasonable neighbor.

I just decided to put a gnome in my yard.

Oh, come on now! A gnome? Really? This neighborhood deserves better than that tacky eyesore. I can't believe you would lower the property values with such tasteless decorations. Gnomes belong in children's stories, not in a sophisticated community like ours. You're ruining the aesthetics of the whole street with that ridiculous gnome. I demand that you remove it immediately and replace it with something more appropriate. And don't even get me started on the noise it makes! Every time the wind blows, that thing probably starts squeaking and rattling. Just think about the peace and quiet the rest of us are trying to enjoy. Honestly, some people have no consideration for their neighbors.
