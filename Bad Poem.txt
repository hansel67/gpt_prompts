Upon that big hill yonder, there's a moon, you see,
Shining all bright and stuff, like, whoa, look at me.
Why's it even shining, this moon so round,
Glowing like crazy, but not making a sound?

It's like, um, a lantern, but up in the sky,
Guiding souls or something, don't ask me why.
You know those glowstick things? Yeah, it's like that,
Doin' its cosmic dance, like a cosmic cat.

Oh, moon, you're like way, way up there,
Chillin' in the sky, like you just don't care.
You got those holes and marks, all over your face,
But you're still shinin' bright, like in some cosmic race.

Yeah, I'm standin' here, starin' at you,
Thinkin' 'bout life, and stuff that's true.
Moon, moon, you're quite a sight,
Even though my words here might not be right.
